🤖 Biped Dancing Robot
This project features a Biped Dancing Robot powered by an Arduino Nano, designed to perform interactive dance moves while responding to obstacles using an ultrasonic sensor. The robot is equipped with 6 servos for leg, foot, and arm movement, a dot matrix display (MAX7219) for visual feedback, and a buzzer for sound effects.

🔧 Features
Performs multiple dance moves (swing, moonwalk, flapping, shaking, etc.)
Obstacle detection with HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
Interactive gestures using 8x8 LED matrix and sound
Easily programmable and customizable via Arduino IDE

🧩 Components Used
Arduino Nano + Nano Shield
6x 360° Servo Motors
HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
MAX7219 8x8 Dot Matrix Module
Buzzer
3D Printed Robot Body

🚀 Functionality
Starts with “IAMBIPED” on the LED matrix and performs a happy gesture
